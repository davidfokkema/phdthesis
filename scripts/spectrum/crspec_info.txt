Information on the cosmic ray spectrum compilation

I made this compilation for an article which appeared in
Scientific American in January 1997. 

The accompanying file sciam1.kumac is a macro file for
the PAW program available from CERN. It needs the associated
data files in the tar file. The data here is as follows:-

leap-prot.dat => data on protons from LEAP balloon payload,
this has to be scaled (by ~2.0) to represent the all particle
fluxes. This scaling is done in the macro.
REF: Seo et al. Ap.J. 1991, v378, p763

akeno => old akeno fluxes 
REF: Nagano et al. J. Phys. G  1984 v10, p1295.

akeno-new-lo
and akeno-fluxes-hi => newer fluxes from akeno
REF: Nagano et al. J. Phys. G 1992 v18, p423.

fe-new => fly's eye
REF: Bird et al. Ap.J. 1994 v424, p491.

yakustk => yakustk data
REF: Afanasiev et al. 1996 Proceedings Int. Symposium 
of Extremely High Energy Cosmic Rays. (ICRR Tokyo) p32.

proton => direct measured fluxes from the proton satellite in the 1960s
REF: Grigorov et al. 1971 Proceedings 12th ICRC, Hobart v5, p1760.
  
haverah =>Haverah Park
REF: Lawrence, Reid, Watson 1991, J. Phys. G. G17, 733.

the file air-sum is some model calculation I made which can be ignored.

the green line is just show how there is some difference from a 
constant power law.

In the event, Scientific American redrew this thing using their own
artists.

A good reference for the overall thing is:-

REF: J. Cronin, T.K. Gaisser, and S.P. Swordy, Sci. Amer. v276, p44 (1997)
